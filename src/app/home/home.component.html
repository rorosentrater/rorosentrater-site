    <p>Hi! Welcome to my website. Here you'll find links to a couple of things I've made and released publicly,
      and ways to get in touch with me.
      I am a full stack software engineer. This website was built by me using Angular for the front-end and a
      number of Amazon web services (AWS) in the backend.</p>
